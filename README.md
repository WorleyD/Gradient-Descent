
# Final Project for COMP 3710 Class

  ## Introduction
This project simulates various gradient descent algorithms on randomly generated linear, quardratic, elliptical, or sinusiodal data, allowing user set variables to modify the gradient descent parameters

___

## Prerequisites

This program requires Python 3.5+, Pygame, and Numpy to be installed in order to run. Once the prerequisites are installed, clone the repository and launch proj . py to begin the program

##  User Parameters

Upon launching the program you'll be greeted with a window consisting of a blank plotting surface, as well as sliders and buttons to tweak parameters, generate data, and run the program. An explanation of all tweak-able parameters is provided below.

TODO

## Running the Program
Once Parameters are tweaked to the users liking, data can be generate by selecting Linear, Quadratic, Elliptic, or Sinusoidal, based on what the user would like to approximate.

From there, simply press generate data until you get data you are satisfied with, and then press 'Run Gradient Descent' button to watch the magic unfold.
